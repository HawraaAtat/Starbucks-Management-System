# Starbucks-Management-System

This is a responsive java project project that talks about a coffee management system with a great GUI design, written in java, with some addition features 
( a simple quiz game that allows employees who pass this quiz to raise their salary)

This application is divided into two parts, employees and admins

The employee can:
  -Sign up / login into his account 
  -Change password
  -Forgot and reset password
  -Change security question
  -Place an order and view the history of orders
  -view the details of bills placed 
 
 
The admin can: 
  -verify employees so they can use their account
  -delete an employee
  -add new product
  -view / edit / delete product
  
Unlike the employees, admins have the right to use all employee features.
