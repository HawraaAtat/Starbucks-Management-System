# Starbucks-Management-System

This is a responsive java project project that talks about a coffee management system with a great GUI design, written in java, with some addition features 
( a simple quiz game that allows employees who pass this quiz to raise their salary with an animated time for each question)

This application is divided into two parts, employees and admins

The employee can:
  -Sign up / login into his account 
  -Change password
  -Forgot and reset password
  -Change security question
  -Place an order and view the history of orders
  -view the details of bills placed 
 
 
The admin can: 
  -verify employees so they can use their account
  -delete an employee
  -add new product
  -view / edit / delete product
  
Unlike the employees, admins have the right to use all employee features.
